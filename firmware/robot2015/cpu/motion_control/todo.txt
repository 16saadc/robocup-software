Motion Control

- refactor gtest and add for firmware code
- exclude Lookup table generator .cpp from mbed build
- figure out FPGA timing
- how does our motion control code interface with the radio stuff?  How about threading?
- verify pseudoInverse function in LinearAlgebra.hpp

- do global search for LqrLookupTableValues.cpp and make sure it's consistent

- refactor simulator to use new LQR controller

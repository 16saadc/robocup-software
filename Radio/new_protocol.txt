38400 bps
90 fps
426 bits/frame: 42 bytes
    Forward: 26 bytes
    Reverse:
        1 gap + 1 sync + up to 12 payload + 2 crc

The 2-byte gap before the beginning of forward data is mandatory and is the sync sequence.
The 1-byte gap before reverse data is for timing budget only.

Motor speeds (drive and dribbler) are signed 8-bit integers.
Kick strength is an unsigned 8-bit integer.

Forward:
    0-3: Motor speeds for robot 0
    4-7: Motor speeds for robot 1
    8-11: Motor speeds for robot 2
    12-15: Motor speeds for robot 3
    16-19: Motor speeds for robot 4
    20: Bit 7:    Special modes
        Bits 6-4: Robot ID for bytes 21-22
        Bit 3:    One-touch enabled (kick only on ball presence)
        Bits 2-0: Robot ID for reverse channel
    21: Kick strength
    22: Dribble speed
    23: Sequence number
    24: CRC low
    25: CRC high

If byte 20 bit 7 is set and bit 3 is clear, then the robot identified in byte 20 bits 2-0 loads PD
coefficients from its motor speeds (P low, P high, D low, D high) in 8.8
fixed-point format.

If byte 20 bits 7 and 3 are set, the reverse channel is read from dribble speed.

Reverse:
    0: Sync 0xc9
    1: Battery
    2: RSSI
    3:  Bits 7-4: Board ID
        Bit 3:    Reserved
        Bit 2:    Charging
        Bit 1:    Ball presence
        Bit 0:    Charge done
    4: Sequence number of last valid forward packet
    5-6: CRC

Radio process usage notes:

Status modes:
    Fixed robot
    Scan robots
    Scan boards

Changing any slow parameters causes the status of that robot to be updated,
because the radio process always gets reverse data for the selected board.

It is recommended to use fixed status mode while kicking to repeatedly
send the kick command in case a packet is corrupted and to quickly read
the ball sense status to determine if the kick is successful.

Scan robots will update status of all robots at 18Hz (90/5).
Scan boards will update status of all boards at 5.6Hz (90/16).

The radio process regularly sends status data on all boards.

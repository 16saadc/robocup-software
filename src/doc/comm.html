<h1>RoboJackets - RoboCup</h1>
<h2>Comm</h2>
<p>
The purpose of Comm is to provide the communication between the host system and 
the base station. Comm uses the radio limitations and speeds to throttle 
packets if nessesary. Its packet format also limits the number of robots that can 
be communicated to at any given time.
</p>
<p>
Comm operates independently of a team and listens for robot control commands from 
both teams. It determines which robots to control based on a hardcoded mapping for 
each team where only one team can be assigned to a robot at a particular hardware ID.
</p>
<p>
Comm also handles the mapping of software robot ID's to hardware ID's as well as 
the mapping of software motors to hardware motors.
</p>

<h3>Running</h3>
<p>
The only command line argument to Comm is the serial port to use for communication 
with the base station.
</p>

<h3>Packets Used</h3>
<p>
Comm accepts <a href="">CommData</a> packets which it then uses to send commands to the robots 
through the base station. It also creates and sends out <a href="">RobotData</a> packets which 
come on the reverse channel back to the host from the robots.

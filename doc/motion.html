<h1>RoboJackets - RoboCup</h1>
<h2>Motion</h2>
<p>
Motion's purpose is the provide the lowest level software control of a robot's 
position and orientation for a particular team. This also includes path planning 
from source to destination and the appropriate rules following for gameplay states.
</p>
<p>
Motion has no concept of any particular state from one command to the next. All 
it knows and uses are the current dynamics of the robot and field and the requested 
destination position and orientation. An optional style flag can be set to indicate 
the preferred style of travel (fast or accurate). Beyond these things, any other 
process has no influence over motion.
</p>

<h3>Path Planner</h3>
<p>
The link between actual robot motion control (PID loops and such) and the path 
planner is through an abstract Path Planner interface. Any particular path planner 
can be used/tried as long as its output is of the required form. The path planner 
interface also provides motion with a way to setup basic avoidance zones. This is 
how motion gives cues to the path planner about which areas of the field to avoid 
during certain game states, and follow the rules.
</p>
<p>
The Path Planner must output two things:
<ul>
<li>distance remaining <strong>along</strong> the path (in standard units)</li>
<li>direction to travel (2d unit vector in team space)</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
This information is then used by motion in the control loops to create motor speeds 
and move the robot. A distance remaining of 0 will cause no motion to occur and 
will bring the robot to a hault. A direction of &lt;0,0&gt; will also have the same 
effect reguardless of distance remaining.
</p>
<h4>Interface (from PathPlanner.hpp)</h4>
<dl>
<dt>PPOut</dt><dd>data structure for the Path Planner output.</dd>
<dt>plan</dt><dd>Method called by motion to plan a path. Returns <em>PPOut</em>.
 And takes in a robot ID, a destination, and a style of travel.</dd>
</dl>
<p>
Motion will call plan for each robot and provide a destination. The path planner 
then plans the path and return the expected output. Motion will then use that 
information to control the robot. Any path planner that adheres to this interface 
can be used.

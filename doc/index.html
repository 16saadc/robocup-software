<h1>RoboJackets - RoboCup</h1>

<h2>Project Overview</h2>
<p>
This is basic documentation for the RoboCup project. It is meant as a guide in 
understanding the code and how to use the various components. Major implementation 
level details are left out and only a broad overview and certain important specifics 
are covered.
</p>

<h2>Terms</h2>
<dl>
<dt>Standard Unit</dt>
<dd>Distance units are always in meters. Angle units are always in degrees. 
Time units are always in seconds (unless otherwise noted).</dd>
<dt>Team Space</dt>
<dd>Team centric coordinate system. Used by a process running only for one team.

<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>
</p>
<h3>OS</h3>
<p>
In order to be able to compile and run any system processes you will need to have a 
linux system (Ubuntu based systems are recommended). You will also need to install the 
following packages:
<ul>
<li>cmake</li>
<li>g++</li>
<li>libqt4-dev</li>
<li>libode-dev</li>
<li>libavformat-dev</li>
<li>freeglut-dev</li>
<li>libboost-dev</li>
<li>libeigen-dev</li>
<li>libswscale-dev</li>
<li>cantlr</li>
<li>libantlr-dev</li>
<li>qt4-designer</li>
</ul>
<h4>For firmware:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Stuff in arm_build.txt</li>
<li>Xilinx WebPACK, with instructions in xilinx_on_64bit.txt</li>
<li>libusb-dev</li>
<li>libftdi-dev</li>
<li>gcc-avr</li>
<li>avr-libc</li>
<li>verilog</li>
<li>gtkwave</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
You will also need to download and install 
<a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/libdc1394" target="_new">libdc1394-2.0</a> for 
the vision application.
</p>

<h3>Compiling</h3>
<p>
To compile any particular application, navigate to the <em>bin</em> directory that application's
directory and run the cmake command specifying the CMakeLists.txt file in the main directory.
<br><br>
<code><strong>I.E.</strong> :.../bin$ cmake ..</code>
</p>
<p>
This will create the nessesary make file for that project. From there, just run <em>make</em> and 
the application will be built.
</p>

<h3>Running</h3>
<p>
Most applications have the same name as their parent directory. Most (except vision and comm) 
also require a <em>-b</em> or <em>-y</em> flag to indicate the team that process is controlling.

<h3>Running the Simulator</h3>
<p>
The simulator is found in SoccSim and provides a simulated environment for testing and for manually controlling the robots. In order to get it up and running, run SoccSim along with Motion. Motion will assume that you are using a USB controller but if you are not it will still work just fine. Control can also be done using ManualControl. The command structure is documented below: 
<ul>
<li><strong>goto:</strong> Takes in an x and y coordinate. Commands the robot to a position relative to its team's coordinate system</li>
<li><strong>rid:</strong> Takes in a number 0-4 that corresponds to the robot's ID. Control switches to the robot whose ID was passed to rid</li>
<li><strong>angle:</strong> Takes in an angle relative to the robots frame of reference and commands the robot to that angle</li>
<li><strong>help:</strong> Provides help</li>
<li><strong>exit:</strong> Closes ManualControl</li>
</ul>
</p>
